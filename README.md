# Portfolio

Redesegined my portfolio website yet again! I am actually happy with this iteration. I still have a ways to go, but I am happy that I can create a decent webpage.  Bult using Boostrap. I plan on using some JS in the future. This is an ongoing project.


## Upcoming Fixes:
* Changing the image displaying on top of the cards
* Adding more cards to more accurately describe my experience
* Making the about me div static and the projects divs scrollable
* Add my actual resume for the download link
* Change the profile picture
